stacks and queues are array-like structures athat differ only in items sre inserted and remmoved.

linkedlists, trees and graphs arestructures with nodes that keep referencec to other nodes.

Hash tables depends on hash functions to save and locate data.t.


in terms of complexity stacks and queue are somplest an can be constructed from linkedlists,
trees and graphs are most complex becoz they extend th econcept of linked list.

hash tales need to utilize these data structures to perform reliably.

linked list are most optimal for recording and storing dtaa, while hashtables are most performant for searching and retrieing hte data.
